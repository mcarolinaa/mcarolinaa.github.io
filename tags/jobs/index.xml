      <description>Presentation and How I became a Data Scientist  Hello!
 My name is Maria Carolina. I currently work as a data scientist, and I started working in this area 2.5 years ago.
  My background is in the area of agricultural sciences, I am an agronomist. Right after graduation, I wanted to work with research, and I went up to the doctorate. I continued in the academic and research path for a few more years, working in undergraduate teaching in agronomy, and in a post-doctorate.</description>
